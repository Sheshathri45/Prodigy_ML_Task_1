Prodigy_ML_01

🎯 Completed: Machine Learning Internship Task 01
📌 Topic: House Price Prediction using Linear Regression 
🏢 Internship: Prodigy InfoTech
🤖 Task: Build a predictive model to estimate house prices using regression techniques.

🔍 This task helped me:

✔ Apply data preprocessing techniques (encoding, scaling, handling categorical variables)
✔ Perform EDA with heatmaps & histograms to understand feature correlations
✔ Implement multiple ML models: Linear Regression, Random Forest, KNN, and Decision Tree
✔ Evaluate models using R² Score, MSE, and MAE for performance comparison
✔ Strengthen my understanding of regression analysis and model evaluation
